<div><b>Drawshield 2.5a Released - Changes:
</b><br/><br/>* All charges are now created from Inkscape files, which makes them much easier to update. The following charges are either new or have been replaced by better images from wikimedia commons - Ibex / Antelope, cricket, hydra, eye, welsh-dragon, knot, crane, wildman, arrow, bundle of arrows, slaughter axe, broad axe.<br/><br/>* There are now over 400 different charges available!<br/><br/>* The highlighting now includes a subtle drop-shadow and has been made the default. If you don't like it, turn it off in options.<br/><br/>* The information "behind" the shield is now much richer, and includes credits for image sources and links to Parker's dictionary for many of the components<br/><br/>My next goals are to reach 500 charges, and to investigate downloading the shield images in other image formats.</div>
