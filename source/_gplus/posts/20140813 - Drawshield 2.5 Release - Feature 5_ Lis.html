<div><b>Drawshield 2.5 Release - Feature 5: List of Charges
</b><br/><br/>And finally... (and at long last!) there is now a comprehensive list of the charges that Drawshield recognises. It can be found at the link below. The columns are are as follows:<br/><br/><b>Names
</b> - the main an alternate names of the charges, in most cases plurals are recognised as well but are not shown here<br/><br/><b>Type
</b> - A fairly arbitrary categorisation that just helps me find things<br/><br/><b>Features
</b> - parts of the charge that may be assigned a different tincture<br/><br/><b>Modifiers
</b> - words that can be used to change the appearance of the charge<br/><br/><b>ignored
</b> - words that are recognised as part of the charge but are (for the moment at least) ignored<br/><br/><b>Proper
</b> - If there is a proper tincture for the charge it is shown here<br/><br/><b>SVG
</b> - the name of the source data file, or "built-in" if it is internal. <i>Important Note
</i> "none" indicates that drawshield recognised the charge but cannot (yet) draw it.<br/><br/>The creation of this file is automated as part of the build process and so should remain up to date with future releases.</div>
