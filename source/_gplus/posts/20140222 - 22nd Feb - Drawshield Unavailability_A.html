<div><b>22nd Feb - Drawshield Unavailability
</b><br/><br/>Apologies folks, my web hosting provider failed to send me a domain name reminder or invoice so my domain name has temporarily expired, meaning that the drawshield site is unavailable at the moment., Obviously, this had to happen on a Saturday Night..., but I have raised an "urgent" support ticket with them anyway.<br/><br/>Thanks to <span><span>+

</a>
</span>Â for spotting this problem first!</div>
