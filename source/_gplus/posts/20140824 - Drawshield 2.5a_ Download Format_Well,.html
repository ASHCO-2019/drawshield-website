<div><b>Drawshield 2.5a: Download Format
</b><br/><br/>Well, that was pretty straight-forward...<br/><br/>Drawshield 2.5a can now download files in any of the following formats (set in the options panel): <i>.png
</i> (the default), <i>.jpg
</i> or <i>.svg
</i> . The first two are 600 pixels high by 500 pixels wide, but I can easily change this if anyone thinks they should be larger. I can also add pretty much any format supported by ImageMagick, which does the conversion from the SVG.<br/><br/>Now onto the rest of those charges...</div>
