<div>On October 2 we had the start of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.<br/><br/>Canada has integrated many Jewish elements in its heraldry, so let's have a look. In this example, we see a Maccabean helmet, a Torah scroll, etc.<br/><br/>Arms : Azure between two menorot a representation of the Holy Ark Or charged on the tympanum with a flame issuant from a vessel Gules the ark ensigned by a closed crown topped with a magen David also Or;<br/><br/>Crest: Between two eagle wings displayed Argent highlighted Sable rising from a circlet of roses Gules seeded Or alternating with lily flowers Argent and maple leaves Gules veined Or an open Torah scroll each roll tipped with a magen David Or;<br/><br/>Motto: In Hebrew from Genesis 28:17, meaning “This is none other than the House of God and this the Gate of Heaven”.<br/></div>
