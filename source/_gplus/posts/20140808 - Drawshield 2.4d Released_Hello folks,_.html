<div><b>Drawshield 2.4d Released
</b><br/><br/>Hello folks, I have automated some of the steps necessary to import charges from wikimedia commons, which means that I can now does this faster! The list of charges now includes:<br/><br/>a <i>fetterlock
</i>, a <i>mill rind
</i> (or <i>fer-de-moline
</i>), a <i>hemp-break
</i>, a <i>bunch of grapes
</i> {leaved}, an <i>eel
</i> {finned}, a <i>dolphin
</i> {crowned, finned}, a <i>hunting horn
</i> {stringed}, a <i>bugle horn
</i> and finally a <i>fishtailled griffin
</i> {armed, langued, beaked}.<br/><br/>(the items in curly braces are features that can have a different tincture).<br/><br/>Can anyone suggest a better name for the "fishtailled griffin"?</div>
