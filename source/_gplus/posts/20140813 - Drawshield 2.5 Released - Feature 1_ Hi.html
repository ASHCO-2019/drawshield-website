<div><b>Drawshield 2.5 Released - Feature 1: Highlights
</b><br/><br/>I am very pleased to announce the release of Drawshield 2.5. This major point release includes a number of significant new features. To allow proper discussion of each I will cover in separate posts, apologies for burdening your reading time...<br/><br/>Firstly, you will notice that a new <b>options...
</b> button has appeared on the "create" page ( <a href="http://drawshield.net/create">http://drawshield.net/create
</a> ). The first new option that I would like your input on is the "Add highlight" checkbox. This produces a subtle overlay, more easily seen on plainer shields. It is based on techniques used on the shields that are found in the wikimedia commons. The intention is to give the shield a metallic "sheen".<br/><br/>What do you think? Is it useful? Should it be darker, lighter? All views welcome!</div>
