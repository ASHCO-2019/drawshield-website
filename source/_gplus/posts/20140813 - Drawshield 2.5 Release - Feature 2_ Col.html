<div><b>Drawshield 2.5 Release - Feature 2: Colour Schemes
</b><br/><br/>There are no "standard" RGB colour codes for heraldic devices (as far as I know!) so the actual colours to be used are up to the herald. I have added a new feature, also to be found under the <b>Options...
</b> panel that allows the user to select from a number of different colour schemes. The actual colours from each scheme can be found here:- <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WNU2TRr1ZfJkWyB6q3aLCOC-pXfhILpGvZZpjc5ZT74/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WNU2TRr1ZfJkWyB6q3aLCOC-pXfhILpGvZZpjc5ZT74/edit?usp=sharing
</a><br/><br/>I can easily add new colour schemes so if anyone would like to suggest their own scheme please get in touch!<br/><br/>You will also notice that one of the colour schemes is called <b>Outlines only
</b>. More of this later...</div>
