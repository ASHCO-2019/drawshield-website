<p>By following the instructions below you can translate blazons from French into English. The result is not 100% perfect but is a good basis for a final translation. In particular, the "style" of French is that used in <em>Rietstap's General Armorial</em>, so for example you can copy the blazons from <a href="http://www.euraldic.com/lasu/bl/bl_a_aa.html">Euralidic.com</a> into the box below and get a reasonable attempt at an English translation.</p>
<table border="1" style="width: 100%; background-color: #EACB8E">
	<tbody  id="table">
	<tr>
		<td>Type or paste a French blazon into the box below, then click here:
			<button id="download" onclick="doTranslate()" class="btn btn-primary">Translate</button></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 95%;"><textarea rows="8" cols="92" name="target" id="blazon"  style="background-color: white"></textarea></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Your translation will appear below. Sometimes there are alternative choices
		that you can chose from a drop-down menu (if none of the options are right chose
		"(n/a)" ). You can overtype any of the other translations if they are wrong. As
		you click in each box the corresponding French word is highlighted in the box below.
		Unknown words are shown in orange, you will need to look these up in a French / English
		dictionary.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 95%;"  style="background-color: aliceblue"><p  id="translation"></p></td>
	</tr>
<tr>
		<td style="width: 95%;"><p id="original"></p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>When you are happy with the translation, press this button:
			<button id="format" onclick="format()" class="btn btn-primary">Format</button>.
		You can still edit the translation below if you want before you
		copy it and paste it somewhere else.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 95%;"><textarea rows="8" cols="92" name="target" id="target" style="background-color: white"></textarea></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>When you have finished here, click here: <button id="restart" onclick="restart()" class="btn btn-primary">Restart</button>
		to start over with a new blazon.</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
