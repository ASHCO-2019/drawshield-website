<h2>Not a complete blazon</h2>

<p>Drawshield looks for a complete blazon and will generate an error message if it doesn’t find one. In particular there must always be a <span class="blazon">“field”</span> (background), if you want something plain just use <span class="blazon">“argent”</span> then any ordinaries and charges.</p>

<h2>Missing number</h2>

<p>DrawShield requires there to be number preceding charges and ordinaries, even if that number is <span class="blazon">“one”</span> (you can use <span class="blazon">“a”, “an”</span> or <span class="blazon">“the”</span> as a synonym for <span class="blazon">“one”</span>), e.g. <span class="blazon">“argent a bend or”</span>.</p>

<h2>Missing Tincture</h2>

<p>Just like numbers, DrawShield always requires the correct number of tinctures (colour) after a charge, ordinary, division or treatment - charges and ordinaries usually require one colour, treatments one or two and divisions two or three. In the case of charges or ordinaries without colours DrawShield will try to find a previous charge or ordinary and use the same colour, but you can make this explicit if you want to avoid problems, e.g. <span class="blazon">“argent a chief and mullet gules”</span> and <span class="blazon">“argent a chief gules a mullet of the same”</span> are equivalent.</p>

<h2>Too Complicated</h2>

<p>The blazon <span class="blazon">“vert a bridge of 3 spans brunatre the middle span larger the parapets festooned with banners gules flying to the dexter over a raging river azure topped with waves argent with severed heads floating in it”</span> will not work. Nor is it ever likely to. Keep it simple! </p>

<h2>Spelling Errors</h2>

<p>DrawShield matches words exactly so spelling errors are not recognised, “glues” will never be interpreted as “gules” even if it was obvious to you what was meant. That said, I do try to include variant but genuine spellings like “fess” and “fesse”.</p>

<h2>Advice</h2>

<p>Probably the most helpful thing that you can do is to start simple and build up your shield one item at a time.</p>
