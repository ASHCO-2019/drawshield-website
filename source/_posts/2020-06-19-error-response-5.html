<h2>Recent Error Reports</h2>

<p>Hello folks, here is a grab bag of fixes, hints and rebuttals arising from recent error reports. Thank you for these, please keep them coming!</p>

<h2>Quick Hits</h2>

<p>As usual, we'll tackle some of the easy ones first…</p>

<p><em>...an eagle displayed sable with [beak] and [talons] gules ,...</em> - the correct term for this is <em>armed gules</em> (which works for all creatures, no matter what claws, fangs or other body parts they possess!</p>

<p><em>... a [candle] argent</em> - we have a <em>candlestick</em>, but not the lone candle, I'll add it to the To Do list.</p>

<p><em>Per bend sinister purpure and argent
    a semy of dogs sable
    dexter statant</em> - not quite sure what the author was trying to do here, the division into two tinctures is fine but semy is used in the manner {tincture} semy of {charge} {tincture} so the rest doesn't really make sense...</p>

<h2>Quarterly</h2>

<p>Quarterly blazons need to be exactly correct otherwise you will not see what you are expecting and will get a confusing and deeply unhelpful error message instead. Here are a couple of recent example reported as errors, but actually incorrect syntax:</p>

<p><em>quarterly
    ONE LION SALIENT ERMINE  ARMED LANGUED CROWNED OR
    SMALLER
    first or... </em> - not sure what the author was intending here, but the first line is not in any quarter. Quarterly should be immediately followed by a quarter number.</p>

<p><em>Quarterly,
    First, argent, a cross gules,
    Second, two Lions... </em> - here the second quartering does not have a field colour. Each quarter must be a complete shield description.</p>

<h2>Other Stuff For the To Do list</h2>

<q>In the charge “lion rampant guardant” the langued color is fixed as a bright red regardless of the tincture assigned. Further more, many heraldic lions have their tongue layered above the head so it doesn’t look like it comes out of their mouth. In current versions the tongue looks glued on the side of the head.</q>

<p>True, this needs fixing... its on the list as #93</p>
