<h1>Keeping in Touch With DrawShield</h1>

<p>There are various ways to keep in touch with things happening on drawshield.net, depending on your needs.</p>

<h2>Just the latest news</h2>

<p>If you just want to hear about bug fixes and new features then follow @drawshield on Twitter (or look at the <a href="/contact/tweets.html"> embedded tweets on this page</a>). If there is more information than can fit
into a single tweet then you might be referred to the <a href="/blog/index.html">drawshield.net site blog</a>, which you can think of as an overflow for twitter updates.</p>

<h2>Learning More</h2>

<p>If you want example images, inspiration, hints and tips the follow the <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/drawshield/posts">"Fun with DrawShield"</a> blog.</p>

<h2>Updates For Developers</h2>

<p>All of the code used on the drawshield.net website, and the shield rendering code is <a href="https://github.com/drawshield"> available on GitHub</a>, where active issues lists are maintained.
You can get a good overview of the state of developments by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/drawshield/projects/2">main project page</a>. The wiki pages belonging to each
repository contain articles about coding and design topics, but these are probably a minority interest.</p>

<p>That's me! My name is Karl Wilcox and I am the author of the DrawShield suite of blazonry programs. You can find out more about me, and some of my other projects and interests at <a href="http://karlwilcox.com">http://karlwilcox.com</a>. I write these programs just for fun, and to keep my web development and programming skills up to date, but I also hope that they are useful in teaching the language and art of heraldry and bringing it to a wider audience.
