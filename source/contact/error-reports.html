pageTitle: "Feedback on reported errors"

<p>On this page I will discuss any errors that are reported to me and explain whether they are indeed errors; or whether they are just shortcomings in the program or misunderstandings of blazonry.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Just list the quarters, e.g. "Quartered  first, azure; second, or; third, gules; fourth, sable; fifth, argent; sixth, murrey.". I will modify the program to understand the "of six", and "the" in front of the quarters.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Gyronny of eight vert and argent an annulet surmounted of a fillet saltire throughout quarterly quartered all counterchanged</h4>
        <p class="card-text">I need to add a fillet saltire (on the todo list). Also, I think that the quarterly quartered is redundant as the counterchange will make it look that way anyway. Finally, the annulet might not appear correctly as most browsers don't seem to render scaled and transformed fills correctly (which is what I need to draw counterchange). A toughie! I'll get back to you on this one...</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Don&#39;t understand words in brackets - Gules two [pales] [or]</h4>
        <p class="card-text">For more than one Pale use the term 'palets' - you can have up to six (but this looks like a lot like 'paly' so there isn't much point!). So for the intended effect use 'Gules two palets or'.</p>
