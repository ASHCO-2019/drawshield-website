<!-- tutorial/03-adding-ordinaries.ejs starts -->

<p>We have added some interest to our shield by splitting the field into
two but we can do more by adding an <em>ordinary</em>. You can think of
these as "big shapes" that fit across the <em>field</em> (the shield
background, remember?). Ordinaries are usually quite large, obvious
features that always appear in the same position on the shield.
Ordinaries have a colour and, as we saw with divisions earlier, the
colour in blazonry almost always comes AFTER the object.</p>

<img src="img/chevron.png" alt="chevron" class="img-fluid" />

<p>Let's look at one example, the <strong>chevron</strong>. We already have
a clue about what it might look like from the previous page, where we
said that <em>per chevron</em> split the shield into two parts by an
inverted 'V' shape. Blazonry is consistent, so we can expect the
<em>chevron</em> ordinary to be something that is also 'V' shaped, and
indeed this is the case. Using some of our newly found colours we can
create the image above. Can you work out what its blazon would
be?</p>

<p>Recall that the field comes first, in this case, plain white, or
<em>argent</em>, then we have a black chevron, so that is a
<strong>chevron sable</strong>, giving us another complete blazon:</p>

<blockquote><em>Argent, a chevron sable</em></blockquote>

<p>Note that we have a put a comma in there, and made things easier to say
by adding 'a'. In most cases, we can add punctuation to the blazon
wherever we think it will help, but we don't have to do it.</p>

<p>Again, this is your chance to try a few things out. Based on what you
already know of <em>divisions</em>, you might have guessed that there
are ordinaries called <strong>a fess</strong>, <strong>a pale</strong>
and <strong>a bend</strong>. Try using these as part of a blazon in the
box to the right and see what appears. Don't forget that you can also
have a divided field AND an ordinary, just remember to ensure that you
provide enough different colours.</p>

<p>There is one other ordinary that is very important and this is the
<strong>chief</strong>. It appears as a thick bar across the top of the
shield and is very common. It has a special feature in that all of the
other things on the shield get scrunched down to make room for it. We
will see an example of this on the next page, when we talk about
<em>charges</em></p>
