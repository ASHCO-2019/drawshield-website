<p>We have already learnt enough blazonry to describe several hundred different shields! Let's see how well you have remembered what we have covered! Look at the shield picture on the left. Can you work out what the blazon would be? Remember, you describe the <em>field</em> (or background) first, then any <em>ordinaries</em>, then any <em>charges</em>, and each item has its colour given immediately afterwards.
</p>

<p>Now work the other way and try to picture in your mind the shield that is described by the following blazon:</p>

<p><blockquote><em>Per chevron or and gules, 3 roundels argent</em></blockquote></p>

<p>What do you think this looks like? Again, go to the next page for the answer!</p>
