<!-- /blazon-reference/arrangements.ejs starts -->

<p>If you simply specify a number of charges then these will be arranged
automatically across the field of the shield. They will all be the same
size and be evenly spaced out. The precise layout depends on a number of
factors, (all of which DrawShield takes into account automatically - or
will do eventually!) These factors include:</p>

<ul> 
	<li>Whether the shield has a <span class="example">chief</span> present</li> 
	<li>What
shape area is available for the charges (e.g. for <span class="example">quartered</span> or
<span class="example">dimidiated</span> shields)</li> 
	<li>For certain numbers of charges,
whether the field is divided (e.g. two charges on a field <span class="example">per
bend</span></li> 
</ul>

<h2>Arrangements in Relation to Other Charges</h2>

<p>It is possible to arrange one charge <span class="keyword">between</span> two or
more other charges; this makes most sense with two or four charges and
there are special arrangements for four charges around one of the four
armed crosses.</p>

<p>One or more charges may also be placed <span class="keyword">on</span> another
charge. Some charges also have modifiers such as <span class="example">holding in it's
hand a</span>. DrawShield will recognise many of these modifiers but does
not yet have the ability to draw many of them properly.</p>

<h2>In Specific Arrangements</h2>

<p>It is also possible to specify a specific arrangement. Obviously
there must be more one than one charge present, but in some cases only
certain numbers of charges make sense. Warnings are displayed if this
situation occurs. The following arrangements are supported:</p>

<span class="keyword">In pale, in pale throughout, in pall, in fess, in fess
throughout, in bend, in bend sinister, in chevron, in pile, in orle, in
saltire, in cross, counter-passant, pilewise, in bar,  in chief
throughout, in a quadrangle, chevronwise, in a triangle, respecting each
other, counter rampant, confronty, addorsed</span>

<p>With some arrangements it is also possible to say that the charges
should be touching by using the term <span class="keyword">conjoined</span>. Note
that this is implemented by calculating the size of the enclosing "box"
leaving no gaps, but if the charge does not extend to all sides of the
box then the charges may not actually touch. Arrangements that are
<span class="example">conjoined</span> work best with the simple geometric shapes.</p>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Some blazons use the terms <span class="keyword">above, below, with</span> and
these terms are recognised but their use is discouraged as it is not
always obvious exactly what is meant. Use specific locations in
preference.</p>
