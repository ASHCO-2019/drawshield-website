<h3>Notes</h3>

<q>This is the unofficial flag of Newfoundland. It appeared in the 1880's and is based on the Irish Tricolor with the orange replaced with pink, the liturgical color of the Catholic Church and one of the colors of the Newfoundland Fishermen's Star of the Sea Association flag. The official flag of the Province of Newfoundland & Labrador was adopted in 1980.</q>
