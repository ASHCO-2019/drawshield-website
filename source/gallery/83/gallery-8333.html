<pre>
    Quarterly, first and fourth gules, a fess argent, a
 crosslet formy in chief shown lower slightly larger
 of the last, second gules, a base indented enhanced
 argent, a lion passant shown much higher or crowned
 azure, third per pile reversed sable and argent
</pre>



<p>Suggested by an anonymous user, who adds:</p>

<q>The third quarter should properly be "argent chape ployé sable", but I don't think DrawShield supports this.</q>
