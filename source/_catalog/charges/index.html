<p>Drawshield supports many hundreds of charges, including all of the most common to be found in traditional Heraldry, and more are being added all the time. The charges are listed by their most common name, however it should also be noted that DrawShield also recognises plurals, alternative names and spelling variations for many of the charges, in addition to those shown here.
</p>
<p> You can search the current list of charges using the box below, and view a thumbnail image. The thumbnail colours have no particular significance except to show those parts of the charge that can have a different tincture (for example, a tree may be <span class="keyword">trunked</span> and <span class="keyword">leaved</span>. The "Go Page" button will take you to the category page that contains that charge.

<p>I have also arranged the available charges into fairly arbitrary categories, you can see all the charges contained in each category by following the links below. </p>
