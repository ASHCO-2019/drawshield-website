pageTitle: Fess Variations

<!-- /catalog/ordinaries/major/index.html starts -->
<p>These are all variations of the fess. The <span class="keyword">bar</span> and <span class="keyword">bar gemel</span> can actually be repeated up to eight times but become increasingly indistinguishable from the corresponding value of <span class="keyword">barry.</span> Some can take variant edge types, as indicated by the plus symbols.</p>
