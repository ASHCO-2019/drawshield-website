pageTitle: Bordure Variations
---
<!-- /catalog/ordinaries/major/index.html starts -->
<p>
    Bordures are a complex subject, as there are potentially hundreds of variations given the different shapes of shields, variant edges and quarterings, each of which
    has their own artistic consideration as well (interior right angles are particularly awkward for many edge variations). Because of this only a limited number
    of bordures are available and they are shown here.

</p>

<p>
    The names shown here are firstly, the overall shield shape; followed by the word "chief" if the bordure respects the presence of the chief; followed by
    the edge variation, if any. If you want force the bordure to cover the chief as well put in last in the blazon, preceeded by the word <em>overall</em>,
    e.g. <em>ermine a chief gules overall a bordure or</em>.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I am enormously grateful to the writers of the "Pattern along Path" extension for Inkscape, without which the variant edges would probably never have been
tackled at all...</p>

<p>At the moment, all quarterings use the rectangular shape, i.e. they do <strong>not</strong> conform to the edge of the shield if they are adjacent to one.
I might do this one day, but don't hold your breath...</p>
